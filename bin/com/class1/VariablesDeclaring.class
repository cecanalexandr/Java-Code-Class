Switch Statement 
A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality
 against a list of values. Each value is called a case, 
and the variable being switched on is checked for each case

 case or default labels. The switch statement evaluates its expression, 
then executes all statements that follow the matching case label. ... 
Technically, the final break is not required because flow falls out of the switch statement.
